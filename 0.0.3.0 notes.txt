***** NEW IN 0.0.3.0 *****

- Enemy NPC: Enemy randomly moves 1 tile in a random direction (or decides to stay) every .5s
	Player must now be lined up with enemy for buster/charged shots to deal damage
	Reducing enemy HP to 0 removes the enemy and displays a victory splash screen


##### Old build notes updated to reflect 0.0.3.0 changes #####

- KEY INPUT MODE
	- w/a/s/d movement
	- "use" chips with 0-5
	- +/= adds chips
	- Spacebar fires/charges buster
	Checkbox below exit button toggles key overlay/input mode

- Movement: there are 2 modes for movement, "swipe" and "tap". 
	The toggle switch above the swipe pad in the bottom left switches between the two 
	(this switch won't stay here, eventually it will become part of a "settings" menu or 
	something like that, but this is just for temporary convenience). 
	In "swipe" mode, you click and drag (with the mouse) within the swipe pad area 
	to move your character (movement is input when your mouse leaves the pad or you release the mouse button), 
	and in "tap" mode, 4 buttons appear on the pad that can be pressed for up/down/let/right movement.

 - Buster: Tapping the buster button fires a shot (invisibly) for 1 damage
	Holding down the buster button will charge your buster. 
	Once the ring around the buster button is full, releasing the button (mouse) fires a 10 damage shot

 - Draw: Clicking the draw button with at least 3 energy (while you have fewer than 6 chips) 
	will spend 3 energy to add a chip

 - Chips: Chips are given random costs when they are created/added. 
	By clicking on a chip when you have enough energy, the chip will disappear, 
	other chips will shift into place (chips always fill from the left), and your energy will drop accordingly. 
	All chips are the same apart from having different costs. 
	Chips have no effect when "used"(clicked) other than reducing energy and vanishing


!!!!! KNOWN ISSUES !!!!!

- Swipe/Tap mode slider toggle and Key Input Mode check toggle react to key inputs
	after clicking either interactable, A/D will move Swipe/Tap toggle, and Space will
	uncheck Key Input toggle (makes using the buster problematic)
*Current Solution: After toggling settings, click anywhere on the screen that isn't an interactable
	to have key inputs not sent to interactable toggles.

- Enemy HP display extends beyond the info box at the top right
	(this issue did not exist in the editor, but does when running build from Unity Player)

- Enemy HP may show 1 when defeated and the game is over
	(matter of the order in which update methods are called)
