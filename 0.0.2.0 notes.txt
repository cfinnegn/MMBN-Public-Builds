Notes on this build:

 - Movement: there are 2 modes for movement, "swipe" and "tap". 
	The toggle switch above the swipe pad in the bottom left switches between the two 
	(this switch won't stay here, eventually it will become part of a "settings" menu or 
	something like that, but this is just for temporary convenience). 
	In "swipe" mode, you click and drag (with the mouse) within the swipe pad area 
	to move your character (movement is input when your mouse leaves the pad or you release the mouse button), 
	and in "tap" mode, 4 buttons appear on the pad that can be pressed for up/down/let/right movement.

 - Buster: Tapping the buster button reduces the enemy health by 1 
	(this will ALWAYS happen, right now there is no target to aim at, 
	so I've essentially set it so you never miss). 
	Holding down the buster button will charge your buster. 
	Once the ring around the buster button is full, releasing the button (mouse) will reduce the enemy health by 10

 - Custom: Custom gauge starts at 3 and gains 1 bar every 2 seconds. 
	The custom bar will change to reflect drawing/"using" chips

 - Draw: Clicking the draw button with at least 3 energy (while you have fewer than 6 chips) 
	will spend 3 energy to add a chip

 - Chips: Chips are given random costs when they are created/added. 
	By clicking on a chip when you have enough energy, the chip will disappear, 
	other chips will shift into place (chips always fill from the left), and your energy will drop accordingly. 
	All chips are the same apart from having different costs. 
	Chips have no effect when "used"(clicked) other than reducing energy and vanishing
