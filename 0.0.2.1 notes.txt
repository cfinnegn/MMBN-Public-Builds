!! SEE 0.0.2.0 NOTES FOR MAIN FUNCIONALITY !!

New to 0.0.2.1:

- The Skybox background is back! (I forgot I had disabled it for some screenshots...)
	A toggle may be added in the future to disable it if its too distracting to look at

- Player info display updates: Text size for HP and chip count increased.
	Chip count of main player now changes to reflect the number of chips in hand

- Exit button added: should work if clicked or when "esc" key is pressed
	(Unity editor disables quitting, so this feature is untested)

- KEY INPUT MODE!! 
	- w/a/s/d movement
	- "use" chips with 0-5
	- +/= adds chips
	- Spacebar fires/charges buster

- Checkbox below exit button toggles key overlay/input mode
	(when this toggle or the swipe/tap slider toggle is clicked, the
	swipe/tap slider toggle will begin moving when A/D are pressed.
	click any non-interactable on the screen to make the slider toggle stop
	reacting to A/D key presses),\.
